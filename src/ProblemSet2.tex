\begin{question}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Disprove: Every triangle has at least one obtuse angle.
        \item Disprove: For all real numbers $x$, $2^x\geq x+1$.
        \item Disprove: For every positive non-prime integers $n$, if some prime $p$ divides $n$, 
            then some other prime $q$ ($q\neq p$) also divides $n$.
        \item Disprove: For all integers $n$, if $n^5-n$ is even, then $n$ is even.

\begin{question}
   (Scheinerman, Exercise 7.12:)
    Another method to prove that certain Boolean formulas
    are tautologies is to use the properties in Theorem~7.2
    together with the fact that $x \rightarrow y$ is equivalent
    to $(\neg x) \vee y$ (Proposition~7.3)
    For example, Exercise 7.11, part (b) asks you to establish that the formula $(x \wedge (x \rightarrow y)) \rightarrow y$ is 
    a tautology.  Here is a derivation of that fact:
    % This is an "align" environment for aligning
    % mathematical equations.  Ampersands (&) denote 
    % separation between columns.  The first one means
    % there will be alignment around the equal sign.
    % The double-ampersands put a second column, left-
    % justified.  Double-backslashes (\\) separate lines.
    \begin{align*}
        (x \wedge (x \rightarrow y)) \rightarrow y
        &= [x \wedge (\neg x \vee y)] \rightarrow y
        && \text{translate $\rightarrow$} 
        \\
        &= [(x \wedge \neg x) \vee (x \wedge y)] \rightarrow y
        && \text{distributive}
        \\
        &= [\mathrm{FALSE} \vee (x\wedge y)] \rightarrow y
        && \text{inverse elements}
        \\
        &= (x\wedge y) \rightarrow y
        && \text{identity element}
        \\
        &= \neg(x\wedge y) \vee y
        && \text{translate $\rightarrow$}
        \\
        &= (\neg x \vee \neg y) \vee y
        && \text{De~Morgan's laws}
        \\
        &= \neg x \vee (\neg y \vee y)
        && \text{associativity}
        \\
        &= \neg x \vee \mathrm{TRUE}
        && \text{inverse elements}
        \\
        &= \mathrm{TRUE}
        && \text{identity element}
        \\
    \end{align*}
    Use this technique [not truth tables] to prove that these formulas
    are tautologies:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $(x \rightarrow \mathrm{FALSE}) \rightarrow \neg x$
        \item $(x \rightarrow y) \wedge (x \rightarrow \neg y) \rightarrow \neg x$
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{question}
	Let the following statements be given.
		\begin{align*}
		p &= \text{``Jeremiah is hungry.''}\\
		q &= \text{``The refrigerator is empty.''}\\
		r &= \text{``Jeremiah is mad.''}
		\end{align*}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Rewrite the following statement as a Boolean expression.\\
			\begin{center}
			If Jeremiah is hungry and the refrigerator is empty, then Jeremiah is mad.
			\end{center}
		\item Construct a truth table for the statement in part (a).
		\item Suppose that the statement given in part (a) is true, and suppose also that Jeremiah is not mad and the refrigerator is empty. Is Jeremiah hungry? Justify your answer using the truth table.

\begin{question}
    Suppose each single character stored in a computer uses eight bits. 
    Then each character is represented by a different sequence of eight 0's and 1's called a bit pattern, 
    such as 10011101 or 00100010. Provide a brief reasoning for the following questions.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item How many different bit patterns are there?
            \item How many different bit patterns are palindromes (the same backwards as forwards)?
            \item How many different bit patterns have an even number of 1's?
            \item How many different bit patterns have the property that their second and fourth digits are 1's?
            \item How many different bit patterns have the property that their second or fourth digits are 1's?

    Suppose we want to make a list of length 5 from the letters $A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J$. Provide a brief reasoning for the following questions.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item How many such lists can be made if repetition is not allowed and the list must begin with a vowel?

            \item How many such lists can be made if repetition is not allowed and the list must contain exactly one $A$?

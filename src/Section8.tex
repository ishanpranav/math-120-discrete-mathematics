\section*{List}
A \textit{list} or \textit{tuple} is an ordered sequence of objects. Elements in a list might be repeated.
\section*{Length}
The number of elements in a list is called its \textit{length}.
\section*{Ordered pair}
A list of length two is called an \textit{ordered pair}.
\section*{Empty list}
A list of length zero is called the \textit{empty list} and is denoted $(\,)$.
\section*{Equal}
Two lists are \textit{equal} provided they have the same length, and elements in the corresponding positions on the two lists are equal. Lists $(a,b,c)$ and $(x,y,z)$ are equal if and only if $a=x,b=y$.
\section*{Concatenation}
Suppose $A$ and $B$ are lists. Their \textit{concatenation} is the new list formed by listing first the elements of $A$ and then the elements $B$. The concatenation of the lists $(1,2,1)$ and $(1,3,5)$ is the list $(1,2,1,1,3,5)$.
